I used this map to decide how valuable a foldable bike might be in my life. The main reason I was interested in a folding bike was to take it easily on the subway or bus or train, and bike from a station - I had a hunch this could give me near 100% access to MetroWest, all without a car.

Turns out, I was right!

TODO:

1. Add ferry stops + radius around them
2. Add central and western mass transit systems - the Pioneer Valley Authority can take me around there, though I'm not sure if they can pick me up in Worcester
3. If I _can_ get to Springfield - add the Hartford line, which then unlocks the MTA, and can get me into a third and fourth state!!!
4. Permit >10mi trips if there are protected bike lanes - I am pretty sure there is a nice one that can maybe also get me from Worcester to Springfield
5. Arguably add Peter Pan buses? Though I'm not sure if they'd let me take on a folding bike
6. Arguably add Amtrak? You can bring on a bike, but its less frequent & more expensive, so not really in the spirit of answering the question "What trips can I do with a folding bike + public transit, for similar time and cost to a car"

This was really fun. The MBTA does a great job posting usable GIS layers to play with, and QGIS was easy to learn - I got to tackle challenges like handling the overlap of my bike-zone radii or filtering the TRAIN_NODES to only include the "real" commuter rail ones (plus cape flyer - I love the cape flyer). Let me know if you have requests or idea to improve this!
